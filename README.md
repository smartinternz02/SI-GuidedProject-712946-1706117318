Project Description:
Facebook isa social networkingsite that makes it easy for you to connect and share with family and friends online.

Today, Facebook is the world's largest social network, with more than 1 billion users worldwide.  There are already a lot of other ways to communicate online, like through email, instant messaging, and so on.
